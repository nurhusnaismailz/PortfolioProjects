The Target transformation uses a flat file connection that writes to the following directory: C:\UserAccountData. The default All Fields rule includes all incoming fields. You create a Named Field rule to exclude the unnecessary user preferences fields.

When you select Create New Target at Runtime, you enter the following name for the target file: SF_UserAccount_%d%m%y.csv.

The mapping task creates a target file named SF_UserAccount_291116.csv in the C:\UserAccountData directory when the task runs on 1st Jan 2022. 

The target file includes all fields from the Salesforce Account and User objects except for the user preferences fields specified in the Named Fields rule.
